## Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel.

Key features of Git include:

- **Distributed Version Control**: This means that every user has a complete copy of the project repository on their local machine. This allows for operations to be performed offline and provides a backup in case the central repository fails.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git's branching model allows developers to work on different features or bugs in isolation, without affecting the main codebase. These branches can then be merged back into the main codebase when the work is complete.
- **Speed**: Git is designed to be fast and efficient, even for large projects.
- **Data Integrity**: Git uses a data model that ensures the cryptographic integrity of every bit of your project. Every file and commit is checksummed and retrieved by its checksum when checked back out.
- **Staging Area**: Git provides a staging area or "index" that allows you to format and review your commits before completing the commit.
