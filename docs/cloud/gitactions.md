## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository. 

With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and deploy your code directly from GitHub. It provides world-class support for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). 

In addition, GitHub Actions allows you to automate other aspects of your development workflow such as assigning code reviews, managing branches, and triaging issues.
