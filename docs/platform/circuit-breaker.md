## Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker

Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker is a service resilience pattern that allows you to provide default behavior when a network failure or any exception occurs while invoking a remote service. It's an abstraction over various circuit breaker implementations like Netflix Hystrix, Resilience4j, Sentinel, etc.

Key components of Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker include:

- **Dependency**: To use Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker, you need to include the `spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-{implementation}` dependency in your project, where `{implementation}` could be `hystrix`, `resilience4j`, `sentinel`, etc.

- **Configuration**: You can configure the circuit breaker parameters like failure threshold, delay time, etc. in the application.properties (or application.yml) file.

- **Usage**: You can use the `@CircuitBreaker` annotation on a method to apply the circuit breaker pattern. If the method throws an exception, the circuit breaker will open and provide a fallback method.
